This repository contains samples of Java, TypeScript, Python, Ansible code generated by Note Web DSL Service for screencasts published on "Note Web" Youtube Channel: [@noteweb3748](https://www.youtube.com/@noteweb3748) . If you clone repository, you'd need to switch between git branches to access codebases for different examples (also because NW DSL Service can easily commit generated codebase straight to a git branch). Populating portfolio is WIP as of August 2024.
